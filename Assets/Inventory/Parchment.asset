  m_itemDesc: "Dear villagers,\r\nI can now inform you that the lantern is officially
    finished. As mentioned during our last meeting, everyone is responsible for the
    safety of this lantern. Please remember to not use the lantern until the nearest
    village\u2019s light is down.\r\nAs the chief of this village, let me share how
    proud I am. Fighting among you to bring the light on humanity is an honour. Soon,
    the battle will start. Many of us won\u2019t make it but we are glad to sacrifice
    our life and let a warrior reach the main city and save us all.\r\n"
